# DAO Governance Matrix

## Introduction:

Welcome to the DAO Governance Matrix, an illustrative example of how decentralization can be measured within a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).
This matrix serves as a guide to demonstrate how various aspects of a DAO's operations can be evaluated for their level of decentralization.
It underscores our commitment to prioritize decentralization and the implementation of autonomous features in every DAO we build.

|------------------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------|-------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| Administration   |  7 of 9 DAs: 78%  |   6 of 8 DAs: 75%  |  4 of 5 DAs: 80%   |  7 of 10 DAs: 70%   |  5 of 5 DAs: 100% |   3 of 5 DAs: 60%  |  2 of 3 DAs: 67%    |
| Financial        |  3 of 5 DAs: 60%  |  4 of 6 DAs: 67%   |  2 of 4 DAs: 50%   |  4 of 7 DAs: 57%    |  5 of 5 DAs: 100% |   2 of 5 DAs: 40%  |  1 of 3 DAs: 33%    |
| Governance       |  2 of 5 DAs: 40%  |  3 of 6 DAs: 50%   |  3 of 4 DAs: 75%   |  5 of 7 DAs: 71%    |  5 of 5 DAs: 100% |   4 of 5 DAs: 80%  |  3 of 3 DAs: 100%   |

## Layer Decentralization Score

The Layer Decentralization Score measures the average decentralization achieved within each layer of a DAO. This score represents an example of how we 
can assess the level of decentralization in functions and decision-making processes within each layer. It is essential to note that actual scores may 
vary depending on the specific implementation of a particular DAO.


|   Layer        | Average |
|--------------  |---------|
| Administration |  75.7%  |
| Financial      |  58.1%  |
| Governance     |  73.7%  |
| Liability      |  75.1%  |
| Security       |  78.7%  |



## Module Decentralization Score

The Module Decentralization Score showcases the level of decentralization achieved within specific modules of a DAO. Each module represents a distinct
area of functionality, and the score indicates the average degree of decentralization attained within that module. The figures provided here are for 
illustrative purposes only, and the actual scores may differ based on the unique characteristics and goals of each DAO.


|   Module            | Average |
|---------------------|---------|
| dApp Front End      |  72.6%  |
| Backend Framework   |  63.3%  |
| Financial Module    |  71.8%  |
| Voting / Governance |  51.2%  |
| dApp Core Logic     |  100%   |
| Data Storage        |   68%   |
| Audits / Security   |  67.6%  |


It is important to emphasize that these scores are presented as examples to illustrate the measurement of decentralization. In practice, we prioritize
the pursuit of decentralization and the integration of autonomous features in every aspect of the DAOs we construct. Our aim is to empower communities, 
foster trust, and create resilient and self-governing organizations.
