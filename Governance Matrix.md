# DAO Governance Matrix

## Introduction:

Welcome to the DAO Governance Matrix, an illustrative example of how decentralization can be measured within a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). This matrix serves as a guide to demonstrate how various aspects of a DAO's operations can be evaluated for their level of decentralization and autonomy.

The matrix comprises rows that represent distinct layers of governance within the DAO, while each column represents a specific module responsible for executing tasks through smart contracts programmed on the blockchain. The decentralized nature and autonomy of these modules are measured using two key metrics: Decentralization Actions (DAs) and Autonomous Actions (AAs).

Decentralization Actions, or DAs, represent the steps taken towards achieving decentralization within a given governance layer and module. These actions capture the extent to which the DAO's processes and operations are built into the DAO itself, minimizing reliance on centralized entities or external authorities. The percentage value associated with each DA indicates the proportion of decentralized actions within the total actions or processes of the respective layer.

Autonomous Actions, or AAs, reflect the level of autonomy achieved within a governance layer and module. These actions measure the extent to which the DAO can independently execute its operations and decisions in alignment with its mission, vision, and values. The percentage value associated with each AA represents the proportion of autonomous actions within the total actions or processes of the respective layer and module.

By employing this matrix, we emphasize our commitment to prioritizing both decentralization and autonomy, and implementing these principles within every DAO we develop. We firmly believe that decentralization and autonomy are essential for fostering transparency, trust, and resilience, allowing DAOs to thrive as self-governing entities.

Decentralized Actions (DAs) refer to the activities or functions within a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that are distributed among the participants and stakeholders. These actions involve decision-making, governance processes, and operational tasks that are collectively executed by the DAO community. DAs aim to empower individuals within the DAO ecosystem, promote transparency, and foster a sense of ownership and responsibility among the participants. Examples of decentralized actions include voting on proposals, contributing to decision-making processes, participating in community discussions, and fulfilling specific roles or responsibilities within the DAO structure.

On the other hand, Autonomous Actions (AAs) represent the automated or self-executing actions within a DAO system. These actions leverage smart contracts, algorithms, and predefined rules to autonomously perform certain tasks or operations without requiring constant human intervention. AAs are designed to streamline processes, enhance efficiency, and reduce the reliance on manual actions. They can range from automated financial transactions, self-executing smart contract functions, to automatic system maintenance and security protocols. By implementing AAs, DAOveloped aims to create a more efficient and self-sustaining ecosystem where certain actions can be executed seamlessly and reliably.

It is important to emphasize that these scores are presented as examples to illustrate the measurement of decentralization. In practice, we prioritize
the pursuit of decentralization and the integration of autonomous features in every aspect of the DAOs we construct. Our aim is to empower communities, 
foster trust, and create resilient and self-governing organizations.
