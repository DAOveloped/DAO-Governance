# DAO Governance Repository

Welcome to the DAO Governance repository for DAOveloped! This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to understand the governance structure and implementation of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) that we consider when DAOveloping. In this readme, we'll introduce how we layer the governance of a DAO using the layers described in the DAO Governance Matrix and how we structure the DAO build according to the modules defined in the matrix.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into three main files:

1. **Governance Layers**: This file provides an overview of the layers of governance within a DAO. It explains the purpose and function of each layer and showcases the decentralization and autonomy achieved in each layer using Decentralization Actions (DAs) and Autonomous Actions (AAs).

2. **Modules**: The Modules file describes the various functional modules that make up a DAO. Each module represents a distinct area of operation within the DAO, and its level of decentralization and autonomy is assessed using DAs and AAs.

3. **Governance Matrix**: The Governance Matrix file presents an illustrative example of how decentralization and autonomy are measured within a DAO. It showcases the DAs and AAs for each governance layer and module, along with the corresponding decentralization and autonomy scores.

## Governance Layers

The Governance Layers file explains how the governance of a DAO is structured into distinct layers. Each layer represents a specific aspect of governance, such as administration, financial, governance, liability, and security. The file provides insights into the decentralization and autonomy achieved within each layer using DAs and AAs.

## Modules

The Modules file outlines the functional modules that constitute a DAO. These modules represent different areas of operation, such as dApp frontend, backend framework, financial module, voting/governance, dApp core logic, data storage, and audits/security. The file evaluates the level of decentralization and autonomy within each module using DAs and AAs.

## Governance Matrix

The Governance Matrix file presents a detailed measurement of decentralization and autonomy within a DAO. It includes the DAs and AAs for each governance layer and module, along with the corresponding decentralization and autonomy scores. The matrix demonstrates how decentralization and autonomy can be quantified and serves as a guide for assessing the level of decentralization achieved in a DAO.

## Layered Governance Structure

At DAOveloped, we believe in creating robust and decentralized governance systems. To achieve this, we adopt a layered approach to governance within a DAO. The layers we utilize are:

1. Administration: This layer focuses on the overall management and coordination of the DAO. It includes activities such as decision-making processes, community engagement, and administrative functions.

2. Financial: The financial layer handles all aspects related to the DAO's financial operations, including budgeting, funding, and transaction management.

3. Governance: This layer is responsible for the governance mechanisms and processes within the DAO. It covers voting systems, proposal management, and community governance.

4. Liability: The liability layer addresses legal and compliance aspects within the DAO. It ensures that the DAO operates within the legal framework and handles any liability or risk management issues.

5. Security: The security layer focuses on the protection of the DAO's assets, data, and infrastructure. It encompasses security protocols, audits, and measures to safeguard against potential threats.

## Modular Structure

To ensure a comprehensive and efficient DAO build, we structure the development process according to the modules defined in the DAO Governance Matrix. These modules include:

1. dApp Frontend: This module pertains to the user interface and interaction layer of the DAO. It ensures a seamless and user-friendly experience for participants.

2. Backend Framework: The backend framework module encompasses the technical infrastructure that supports the DAO's operations. It includes smart contract deployment, API integrations, and database management.

3. Financial Module: This module handles the financial aspects of the DAO, such as payment processing, token management, and accounting functionalities.

4. Voting/Governance: The voting and governance module focuses on implementing democratic decision-making processes within the DAO. It provides mechanisms for voting on proposals, managing voting rights, and governance-related operations.

5. dApp Core Logic: This module represents the core logic and functionality of the DAO's operations. It includes the implementation of smart contracts, business rules, and protocols that govern the DAO's behavior.

6. Data Storage: The data storage module is responsible for securely storing and managing the DAO's data. It includes database systems, IPFS integration, and data privacy considerations.

7. Audits/Security: The audits and security module ensures the integrity and security of the DAO's infrastructure and operations. It involves regular security audits, vulnerability assessments, and the implementation of robust security measures.

## Decentralization Actions (DAs) and Autonomous Actions (AAs)

Throughout the development and implementation of the DAO, we prioritize both decentralization and autonomy. We measure the level of decentralization and autonomy using Decentralization Actions (DAs) and Autonomous Actions (AAs), as defined in the DAO Governance Matrix.

DAs refer to the steps taken to achieve decentralization within each layer and module. They capture the extent to which the DAO's processes and operations are decentralized, reducing reliance on centralized entities or external authorities.

AAs, on the other hand, represent the level of autonomy achieved within each layer and module. They reflect the DAO's ability to independently execute operations and decisions in alignment with its mission and values, leveraging smart contracts and automation.

By implementing DAs and AAs, we strive to create transparent, resilient, and self-governing DAOs that empower participants and optimize efficiency.
